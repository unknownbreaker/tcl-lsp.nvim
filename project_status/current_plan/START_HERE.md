# 🚀 START HERE - Quick Navigation

## ✅ What's Done
- Switch statement fix: Applied successfully
- TCL parser tests: **12/12 passing (100%)** ✅
- TCL parser status: Production ready

## ❌ What Needs Fixing
- Lua integration tests: 23/39 passing (59%)
- **Problem:** Lua can't access TCL parser (bridge broken)
- **Impact:** 16 tests returning nil instead of valid AST

---

## 📚 Your Action Plan

### Step 1: Understand the Situation (5 min)
👉 Read: [EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md)

**TL;DR:** TCL parser works great. Lua-TCL bridge is broken. Need to debug and fix the integration layer.

---

### Step 2: Run Diagnostics (15 min)
👉 Follow: [DIAGNOSTIC_GUIDE.md](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/DIAGNOSTIC_GUIDE.md)

**Quick Test:**
```bash
# Does TCL parser work?
echo 'set x 42' | tclsh tcl/core/ast/builder.tcl

# Expected: Valid JSON output
# If this fails: Something's very wrong
# If this works: Problem is in Lua bridge
```

---

### Step 3: Fix the Issues (6 hours)
👉 Follow: [PRIORITIZED_FIX_PLAN.md](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/PRIORITIZED_FIX_PLAN.md)

**Three Phases:**
1. **Fix Bridge** (3 hrs) → 23 to 33-35 tests passing
2. **Fix Types** (2 hrs) → 33-35 to 37 tests passing  
3. **Fix Structure** (1 hr) → 37 to 39 tests passing ✅

## 🎯 Expected Timeline

| Day | Task | Time | Result |
|-----|------|------|--------|
| **Day 1** | Diagnostics + Bridge Fix | 3-4 hrs | 33-35/39 passing |
| **Day 2** | Type Conversions | 2 hrs | 37/39 passing |
| **Day 3** | Final Polish | 1 hr | **39/39 passing** ✅ |

**Total:** ~6 hours to 100%

## 📋 Quick Reference

### Test Commands
```bash
# Full test suite
make test-unit

# Just parser tests
make test-unit-parser

# Single test (with debug)
nvim --headless -u tests/minimal_init.lua \
  -c "lua require('plenary.busted').run('tests/lua/parser/command_substitution_spec.lua')" \
  -c "qa!"
```

### Key Files
- **Lua Parser:** `lua/tcl-lsp/parser/ast.lua` ← Fix here
- **TCL Parser:** `tcl/core/ast/builder.tcl` ← Already works
- **Test File:** `tests/lua/parser/ast_spec.lua`
